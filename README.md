Always start by running a trading bot in "Sandbox Mode" or "Paper Mode" for at least 30 days. Do not engage real funds until you understand how it works and what profit/loss you should expect. We strongly recommend basic coding skills and Python knowledge. Review the source code to understand the bot's mechanisms, algorithms, and techniques. Maintain separate wallets for bot operations and storage. Ensure compliance with local cryptocurrency regulations, proper tax reporting, and legal authorization for automated trading activities.
